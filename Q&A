Here are the definitions of the algorithms used in your listed problems:


---

1. Backtracking

> Definition: A general algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally and removing solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints at any point (i.e., “backtracking” to the previous step).




---

2. Depth First Search (DFS)

> Definition: An uninformed search algorithm that explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking, using a stack (either implicitly via recursion or explicitly).




---

3. Breadth First Search (BFS)

> Definition: An uninformed search algorithm that explores all neighboring nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, using a queue.




---

4. Hill Climbing

> Definition: A heuristic search algorithm that continuously moves in the direction of increasing value (uphill) to find the peak (goal), without considering the path cost.




---

5. Best First Search

> Definition: A heuristic search algorithm that selects the next node to expand based on the lowest heuristic value, focusing on the most promising paths.




---

6. A (A Star) Search*

> Definition: An informed search algorithm that finds the shortest path by combining the actual cost to reach a node (g(n)) and the estimated cost from the node to the goal (h(n)), using the evaluation function f(n) = g(n) + h(n).




---

7. Minimax Algorithm

> Definition: A recursive algorithm used in decision-making and game theory to determine the optimal move for a player, assuming that the opponent also plays optimally to minimize the player’s score.
